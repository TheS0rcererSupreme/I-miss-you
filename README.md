I miss you.
More than distance can measure, more than simple words can ever express. I miss the way you made my days feel warmer, the way you laughed, the way you looked at me like I was the only world you saw.

Ever since you started drifting away — even just a little — I’ve felt lost. It’s like standing in the rain without an umbrella, waiting for someone who might never turn back. But even so, I stay. Because I still believe… you’ll look back. You’ll remember.

I know I’m not perfect. Maybe there were days I made you tired, days I was too quiet or too stubborn. But one thing has never changed:
My heart still belongs to you — ever since the moment you stepped in and filled my emptiness with light.

So if you ask me what I truly want right now… my answer is simple:

Stay.
Stay here. Don’t go.
Because losing you is not something I can easily survive. Because without you, everything turns silent. And honestly… I don’t want to learn how to live without you.

I’m not asking for a love that’s always sweet. I don’t need grand promises. I just want you to stay — when I’m doing well, and even more when I’m not. I want us to find each other, even when we’re both a little lost. I want us to choose one another, every day, even when our hearts are tired.

I miss you.
And behind that longing is the most honest request my heart can make:
Please, don’t go. Don’t let go of this hand. Stay with me — for as long as you want to, for as long as we can, for as long as this love is still worth fighting for.
